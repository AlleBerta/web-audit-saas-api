# Sample Reports

This folder contains sample security reports generated by the scanning engine during the validation phase of the thesis project.

Each report corresponds to a publicly available vulnerable target used for testing:

- **ginandjuice.shop** (PortSwigger Web Security Academy)
- **pentest-ground.com** (Pentest-Tools vulnerable lab)

Reports are exported exactly as produced by the platform, without manual modifications.
